    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>My name is Gedeon and I'm excited to learn web development. This is my first real HTML webpage.</p>
    <p>In this project, I'm practicing how to use headings, paragraphs, and links with images.</p>
    <p>I love learning new skills, and building websites is something I've always wanted to do.</p>
    <p>Thanks to ALU and Holberton School!</p>
